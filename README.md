Understanding Adolescent Alcohol Abuse: An Exploration and Solution Proposal

In this project, our focus is on understanding and addressing the concerning issue of alcohol use and abuse among adolescents and college-age populations. The provided statistics paint a troubling picture, showcasing the dire consequences of alcohol-related incidents in this demographic. Our goal is to use the available data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to identify patterns, risk factors, and concentrations of heavy drinking among adolescents in the state of Oklahoma (OK) during the year 2009.

To achieve this, we undertake a multi-faceted approach:

Exploring BRFSS Data: We dive into the BRFSS data warehouse, a comprehensive source of health-related survey responses. This treasure trove of information allows us to gain insights into participants' responses relevant to adolescent alcohol consumption. By focusing on "Heavy drinkers," we aim to analyze the prevalence of alcohol abuse in this demographic during the specified time period and within the state of OK.

Proposing Risk Identification Methods: Our project also involves proposing methods to identify groups of adolescents at the highest risk for alcohol abuse. By delving into the data, we intend to uncover patterns, demographics, and contextual factors that might contribute to higher susceptibility. These insights can serve as a basis for targeted interventions and prevention strategies.

Data Warehouse Design and ETL: An essential aspect of this project is designing a Data Warehouse schema to facilitate effective data analysis. We create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) comprising fact and dimension tables, establishing relationships that streamline the analysis process. Our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts in SQL ensure seamless data transfer from the provided data sources to the designed schema.

Identifying High and Low Concentration Areas: We also aim to pinpoint geographical areas within OK that have the highest and lowest percentages of respondents reporting adolescent alcohol abuse. By city and by county, we formulate SQL queries that allow us to extract this valuable information. This step offers a spatial perspective on the issue, aiding in targeted policy formulation and intervention strategies.

Through these multifaceted steps, our project seeks to unravel insights into adolescent alcohol abuse trends, risk factors, and geographical concentrations. The analysis will empower us to propose data-driven interventions and preventive measures to mitigate the alarming statistics related to alcohol use among young populations. Our ultimate objective is to contribute to informed decision-making that can lead to healthier and safer communities for adolescents in the state of Oklahoma.
